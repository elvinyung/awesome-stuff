# Awesome Stuff
Curated list of miscellaneous stuff that will probably eventually help me.

## Systems
### Operating
* [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) - Very nice introductory to operating systems stuff, with good coverage of new technology. The whimsical tone makes it a fun read. Better than [the Dinosaur Book](https://www.amazon.ca/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1118129385) in my opinion.
* [Showstopper!](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717) - About the development of Windows NT. Given the amount of computing analogies, I think this is intended for a nontechnical audience. Still a great read regardless, with lots of insight into various OS design decisions.
